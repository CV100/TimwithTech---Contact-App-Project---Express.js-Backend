Hello, this is a version of the contact app project of the Youtuber TechwithTim (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PppslXOR7TA).

In the original video, the contact app is designed with a python/Flask backend and a react frontend.

This app is done with a Node.js/Express.js backend, leaving the react frontend nearly unchanged.

Have fun exploring - and we are happy for comments/suggestions how to improve the code!
